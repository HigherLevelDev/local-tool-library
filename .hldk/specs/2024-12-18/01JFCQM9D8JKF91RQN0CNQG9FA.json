We now need to integrate it into the project in the following way:\n\n1) Update the build script so that it builds the frontend project before building the backend project\n2) Update the backend so that it mounts the frontend dist directory and serves the contents when running and any url that doesn't begin with /api should be routed to the frontend",
  "commitMessage": "Integrate frontend with backend:\n1. Updated build script to build both frontend and backend\n2. Modified backend to serve frontend static files and handle routing",
